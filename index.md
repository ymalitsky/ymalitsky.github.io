I am an Assistant Professor in Computational Optimization at University of Vienna. I received my PhD (2015) from Kyiv National University, where I was advised by Prof. V. Semenov. After that I had postdocs in Graz, Göttingen, and Lausanne. Then I joined Linköping University, Sweden as a WASP faculty assistant professor.

**Research Interests**: My research area is continuous optimization. Primarily, I study existing algorithms and develop new ones. Related areas of interest include  numerical linear algebra, algorithms, dynamical systems, stochastic methods, optimal transport, and machine learning. I like nice theorems, simple algorithms, and interesting applications.

**Name**: Besides "Yurii Malitskyi", I sometimes use another spelling "Yura Malitsky". Both are fine.
