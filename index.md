**Research Interests**: My research area is continuous optimization. Primarily, I study existing algorithms and develop new ones. Related areas of interest include  numerical linear algebra, algorithms, dynamical systems, stochastic methods, optimal transport, and machine learning. I like nice theorems, simple algorithms, and interesting applications.
