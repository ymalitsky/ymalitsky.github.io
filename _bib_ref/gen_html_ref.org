#+TITLE: Gen_html_ref

* Given bib file with my articles, how to generate the bibliography?

** Run this code to generate bibliography
1. We use bibtex2html tool to convert into html table. I wish it was just a list, but no idea how without a deep dive.
2. Then we remove some redundant last lines.
3. We add another empty line to the html table.
4. We add ~~~ to the top and end of the file to make it markdown-like.

5. After this, we have numbers next to papers as links that do not work. We want to make them plain text. For this I use sed two times more. That is from ~[<a name="malitsky2020forward">2</a>]~ I want to keep only number ~2~.
6. Finally, we copy our produced file to the assets.

#+begin_src bash   :exports none  :results n
bibtex2html -s abbrv -d -r -o ref -e note -nodoc -q -noheader  -nobibsource ref.bib
sed -i -z 's/<hr><p><em>This file.*//'  ref.html
sed -i '3 i\<tr valign="top">' ref.html
sed -i '1 i\~~~' ref.html
sed -i -e '$a~~~' ref.html
sed -i 's/<a name.*">//g' ref.html
sed -i 's/<\/a>]/]/g' ref.html
cp ref.html ..//_assets/mypapers.md
#+end_src
